The color defined in the meta data field should be valid.

- [x] This is a task of daily note format. It has no explicit dates provided.  #TODO
- [ ] However, you can also assign dates of other formats (TasksPlugin, Dataview  and etc.), by doing so the assigned dates will be used for the corresponding field. 🛫 2023-02-26 📅 2023-02-26 
- [ ] Other meta data like priority can also be assigned. ⏫  📅 2023-02-27 
- [ ] A new task to test the task items with dates of another year 📅 2024-02-26 ⏳ 2024-02-26 🔽  

These texts are not of a task item, but as I type them, the views will update automatically because the on-modify event has been connected to the update handler of the plugin.
