# Tasks Calendar Wrapper

This is a simple wrapper for Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar (https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar) and Obsidian-Tasks-Timeline (https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Timeline).

This plugin provides setting pages and update support for [702573N](https://github.com/702573N)'s great work, for detailed information
about the options, see [Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar](https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar) and [Obsidian-Tasks-Timeline](https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Timeline).

# News

I am currently re-implementing both the calendar and timeline views with typescript and react, so that they can be integrated in the plugin in a real way!

An alpha version which integrates the timeline view will be released soon!

- 2023-02-26: Alpha version with timeline view released, but with no setting tab... I am still working on that.
